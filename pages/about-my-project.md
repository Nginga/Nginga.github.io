subtitle: Monitoring Urban Air Pollution from Satelite Data Using Machine Learning
project_title: " Monitoring Urban Air Pollution from Satellite Data Using Machine Learning"

problem: |
    Urban air pollution poses significant health risks, especially in rapidly growing cities, yet ground-based monitoring stations are often expensive to maintain, and limited in spatial coverage. This lack of widespread, real-time monitoring hinders early detection and policy response to hazardous pollution levels.

    This project aims to leverage satellite imagery and atmospheric data, combined with machine learning models, to estimate pollution levels across urban landscapes. By creating a scalable, low-cost air quality prediction system, we seek to support public health interventions and environmental policy decisions in underserved urban regions.


approach: |
    We will collect and integrate both satellite-derived data (such as Aerosol Optical Depth [AOD], land surface temperature, and vegetation indices) and available ground-based air quality measurements (PM2.5, temperature, humidity, wind speed). Focus areas will include cities with reliable monitoring networks to serve as ground truth.

    Using these datasets, we will develop and train machine learning models to learn the relationship between satellite observations and ground-level air pollution. Data preprocessing steps will include cloud masking, spatial interpolation, and temporal alignment. Once trained, the models will be applied to areas lacking ground sensors to estimate daily PM2.5 levels at a high spatial resolution. Model performance will be evaluated using cross-validation and comparison with held-out sensor data.

outcome: |
    A machine learning model capable of accurately estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations using only satellite and meteorological data.

    High-resolution pollution maps for urban areas without dense ground sensor coverage, enabling improved understanding of spatial pollution variability.

    A low-cost, scalable system that can be adapted for other regions or pollutants (e.g., NOâ‚‚, ozone).

    Insights into key environmental and meteorological drivers of urban air pollution.

    A foundation for public health alerts and long-term environmental policy planning in low-resource urban settings.
