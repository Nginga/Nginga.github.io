subtitle: Monitoring Urban Air Pollution from Satelite Data Using Machine Learning
project_title: "AeroWatch AI: Monitoring Urban Air Pollution from Satellite Data Using Machine Learning"

problem: |
    Urban air pollution poses significant health risks, especially in rapidly growing cities, yet ground-based monitoring stations are often sparse, expensive to maintain, and limited in spatial coverage. This lack of widespread, real-time monitoring hinders early detection and policy response to hazardous pollution levels.

    This project aims to leverage satellite imagery and atmospheric data, combined with machine learning models, to estimate pollution levels across urban landscapes. By creating a scalable, low-cost air quality prediction system, we seek to support public health interventions and environmental policy decisions in underserved urban regions.


approach: |
  We will utilize satelite data and ground data in regions covered by both ground monitoring systems and satelites. The data will then be examined to train AI model so that we can predict ground data values in regions where we can only observe satelite data.

  TBD
