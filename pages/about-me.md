  bio: |
    Iâ€™m rising Senior studying Electrical Engineering at Aabama A&M University. I expect to graduate in May 2026.
    I've previously been working on Fabrication of Nano-structured electronic devices. This summer I'm super excited to be embarking on a new journey of implementing AI in climate study.
    On my spare time, I workout, watch anime, or call friends and family.
