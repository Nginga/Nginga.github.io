what_i_learned: |
  Today we went through model error analysis. We discussed different error measurement parameters including absolute error, root mean square error, and r_2 values. To further understand perfomance metrics, we discussed the importand of feature importance and how certain features can be removed if ther matrics are too low in assisting our predictions. We also got new data to employ these testing methods in our models. Later we had a discussion on AOD and how it is measured. We got more work to look into how PM2.5 concentrations are measured and how they vary at different times of the day.

  The building was super hot in Calloway, and we had to move to business school after lunch.

reflection: |
  Today was a bit tough due to AC issues and discomfort. However, learning still went on and we were able to get throught the morning before moving to the business building after lunch. We also got work to do in pairs and this helped in refining our model outputs since we could compare and make adjustments together. Learning more about errors and perfomance metrics was fun since I have done something similar before in numerical methods class.
