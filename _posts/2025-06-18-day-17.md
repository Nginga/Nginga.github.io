what_i_learned: |
  Today we met as a group in the morning during enrichment and I learnt an intreresting skill: summarizing. We were asked to sum up our project into a 30 second pitch and then present without mentioning the key terms. We did well on that. Next, we played a game of survival were we arranged items by order of importance for a person strunded on a cruise in the ocean. We then went on to meet with highschool teachers. We first went through our 30 second pitches and they were able to determine what our projects were. We then introduced them to the details of our project and also had to figure out reasons for inconsistencies in the data we ran in our models. We polished those using tuning method of grid parameters.

blockers: |
  Our r_squared values were not as expected. We had to try figuring out what the issue is since preprocessing went well. 

reflection: |
  Today was interesting to have a new member in our team. We did an ice breaker that included using chatGpt to create superhero versions based on our top 3 strengths and weaknesses. It made me learn about my teammates better, and also reflect on my own qualities. I was also glad to learn more about my project as we got Ms Jones up to speed with the work we are doing. I also appreciated the fact that we were able to identify issues with the models we deployed yesterday before the mentor came through to point them out.
