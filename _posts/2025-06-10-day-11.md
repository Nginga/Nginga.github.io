what_i_learned: |
  Today I learnt about the lifecylce of aerosols. We discussed the four main stages that include : Sources, Transformation, Transportation, and Sinks. The sources were said to have different categories including natural and anthropogenic. Transportation also occurs vertically or horizontally and is mainly impacted by particulate size and temperature. Transformation occurs due to aging and coagulation. particles can change chemically due to age. Finally, sinks include things like rainfall that remove aerosols for the air. Lasts we worked on compiling and submitting python deliverables from yesterday, and critiquing two articles on aerosol life-cycles. 

blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was more relaxed as we spent most of the time in a very informative session on aerosol life-cycles. It was great to dicuss these while alluding to realife examples like African temperatures, and some Tsunamis that have occured in the past. We also had an opportunity to work together as a team in completing our python deliverables. Collaborating has always proved to be the most efficient and easy to learn approach for us. A good takeaway from today is to keep looking into more literature so as to better understand the concepts of climate and to also keep working on python!
