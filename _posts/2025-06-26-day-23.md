what_i_learned: |
  Today we started the day by making corrections to our presentation as we had been told yesterday. We removed repititive bullet points from our individual sections and emphasized more on the flow and coherence of our presentation. The results page had a number of adjustments as we had not exhausted evrything that we had on our outputs. The rest of the day was spent on diving into neural networks. Our mentor told us its the next aspect of programming the we will be exploring and so we jumped into it so that we know whats going on when we start working on them. I learned the difference between regular neural networks and deep learning and that neural networks become deep learning when the number of nodes > 3. I also learned concepts like wheighting, forward and backward probagation, gradient decent, and loss functions. I had a good grasp of the fundamentals of neural networks, and im looking forward to expanding on that knowledge.

  Had some challenge understanding the meaning of some matrices, but chatGPT helped with the explanations.

reflection: |
  Today was very calm as we spent some of it working on the presentation and then the rest on studying neural networks. I realized that i learn better by pre-emping through reading first, and then watching videos. I combined these different methods and this helped me get a better visual of what each algorithmn was doing, especially the weighting and hidden layers. I also utilized chatGPT and realized how it can help simplifying some of the concepts which may not be explained in simple terms on the websites. Neural networks feel like the peak of our mountain, and I'm excited to see what lies ahead.
