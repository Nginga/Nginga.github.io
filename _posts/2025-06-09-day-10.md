what_i_learned: |
  Today we harmered in on the most important first step in ML. Data cleaning and organization was the topic of the day. We utilized python pandas and its various methods to read, writie to, and edit data files. We also learnt how to merge two documents after cleaning them. the cleaning methods involved checking for columns or rows with missing data and removing them. These skills were very fascinating to learn!

blockers: |
  Suns heat and a couple of insects roaming around during the LiDAR cleaning process. Nothing we couldn't overcome!

reflection: |
  The support was fantastic today. Our mentors helped in the learning process as we worked on pyhton pandas in google colab. It was also interesting to see how we can collaborate as teammates in trying to figure out and debug challenges we face in our code. I also enjoyed the different sources of information like w3 schools which we utilized in figuring out the issues with our code.
