what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about cutting-edge brain-computer interface (BCI) research from a professor at The University of Alabama. He introduced us to how brain signals and muscle movements can be used to control robotic systems. It was fascinating to learn how signals like blinking and jaw clenching can trigger movement in robotics, and how this research could enhance accessibility and human-machine interaction in the future. I also reinforced my understanding of LSTM performance evaluation by calculating additional metrics like R², RMSE, MAE, and MSE, and reviewing the implications of each for model accuracy and reliability.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Today’s session reminded me of the importance of interdisciplinary innovation—how combining neuroscience, engineering, and AI can lead to meaningful and impactful technologies. Getting to physically interact with BCI-controlled robots made the research feel very real and tangible. It was also a great moment of team bonding and curiosity. Meeting with our graduate mentor helped us refocus on our timeline, especially as we prepare to wrap up the program. There’s a strong feeling of urgency and pride as we prepare our final report and slides, and I’m motivated to finish strong.
