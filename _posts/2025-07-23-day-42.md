what_i_learned: |
  Today was entirely focused on producing our project pitch video. We spent the day filming at different sites to capture relevant footage that visually communicates the importance and process of our research. We took multiple takes to ensure clarity and quality, and afterward, we compiled and edited the clips using Clipcut. This stage involved selecting the best scenes, trimming, and arranging them to create a smooth flow for the final video. It was a hands-on experience in visual storytelling and technical editing.

  It was hot outside and getting the best views and lighting was a challenging for the outdoor recordings.

reflection: |
  Working on the video pitch today helped me appreciate the importance of translating scientific research into a format that is both accessible and engaging to a broader audience. It required teamwork, creativity, and attention to detail. While it was different from our usual data-driven tasks, the process helped reinforce the core message of our project and made me think critically about how to present our work visually. I’m looking forward to adding the voice-over tomorrow to complete the story and bring the presentation to life.
