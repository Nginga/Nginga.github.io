  Today we focused on finalizing and editing our elevator pitch video. After refining the footage and tightening the transitions, we produced a polished video that effectively communicates the goal and impact of our project. Our mentors reviewed it and gave very positive feedback, which was encouraging. In addition to the video, I continued working on key sections of our final report, particularly the background and the student headshot section. On the technical side, I also explored how to determine feature importance for the LSTM model, which will help us better understand which inputs have the greatest influence on our predictions. To wrap up the day, we participated in a fun team bonding session — a Jerusalema dance tutorial led by Dr. Li.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Today highlighted the importance of both communication and collaboration in research. Polishing our video required creative problem-solving and teamwork, while writing the final report reminded me of the value of clear, structured documentation. Exploring LSTM feature importance made me realize there's still a lot to learn about model interpretability in deep learning. Ending the day with the dance session brought a refreshing sense of connection and balance to an otherwise task-heavy schedule. This was a good reminder that research is not just about data and models, but also about the people behind the work.
