what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to effectively write a research report, with a focus on structuring abstracts and introductions to clearly communicate the purpose, methods, and significance of our work. During our writing session, I also practiced how to summarize academic papers by identifying key points, objectives, and results—skills that are essential for both understanding literature and writing our own publication. Additionally, I reviewed the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), learning how they process spatial data through convolutional layers, pooling, and feature extraction, and how they differ from LSTMs in handling time-series data.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Later in the day, I made several adjustments to my LSTM model, including tuning hyperparameters and setting the date column as the time index to better align with the 30-minute intervals in our dataset. While these changes helped refine the model's temporal structure, the performance gains were modest, with only a slight increase in R²—from 0.70 to 0.73. This showed me that not all changes produce dramatic improvements, but small enhancements still contribute to a more robust and reliable model. It was a good reminder of the iterative nature of model development and the importance of understanding both the strengths and limits of our approaches.
