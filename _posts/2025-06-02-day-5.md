what_i_learned: |
  Today I had the opportunity to lean more about the overview of our project at surface level. We were introduced to data collection methods using ladar and drones, and also got the chance to tour the lab. We were given assignments to look into two literatures that cover anything related to our topic but mainly urban air pollution and aerosols. A lot of concepts involving effect of pollution to the environment were introduced.
  Learned more about AI in the main session. Main points involved the understanding of how AI models learn new information and independent and dependent variables. Also played a new game of building Marshmello balancing using spaghetti. 

blockers: |
  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  The team is very fantastic in person! Learning more about what to anticipate in the program got me excited and ready to start. We had great connetions through reflections involving what had gone wrong previously and how the team ended up working together to overcome the challenges. This tought us that we can all start in different levels and still end up achieving the goal as long as we work together and prioritize each individual's strengths.
