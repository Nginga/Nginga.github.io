what_i_learned: |
  Today we went through literature to find the roots and background of Random forest as an ML tool. We found 3 literatures and discussed them as a team, learning more about models.We learned about supervised and unsupervised ML. We also looked for literature that covers ML ans AI in climate science. We then worked on making citations for all our papers we had summarized so far using APA 7th edition. We later identified that our project uses supervised data since its labelled data, and we provide it with uestions and ansers. Supervised data can be split into classification and regression while unsupervised only uses clustering. Ours uses regression since our prediction outputs are continuous PM2.5 concentration values.

reflection: |
  Today felt like we were getting closer to the heart of our project. Learning about machine learning models and algorithms was eye opening. I enjoyed learning in detail about the models and algorithms and being able to classify our project based on my understanding of what we learned. I also appreciate the patience of our graduate mentors and especially the slides they create to help us reinforce our understanding. Im really looking forward to where this is going.
