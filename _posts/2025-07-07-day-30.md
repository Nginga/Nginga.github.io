what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on learning about neural networks through a combination of YouTube tutorials, research papers, and Google Gemini. I wanted to dive deeper into these models to better understand how they could support our project work. In particular, I spent time reviewing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks because they are especially relevant for time series prediction tasks like ours. LSTMs are well-suited for handling sequential data, which aligns with the hourly air quality readings we've been working with. This refresher gave me a stronger foundation in how neural networks learn patterns over time, and it also helped clarify some of the concepts I’ve encountered in the papers we’ve been reading. The rest of the time was spent reflecting on how we might incorporate or compare neural models to the gradient boosting models we’ve been using.

  Felt a bit cold today in our office. I will bring my jucket going forward.

reflection: |
  Today’s major highlight was diving deeper into neural networks and being able to add to what I already understood about deep learning. I really enjoyed the process of exploring LSTM models more intentionally, especially because they relate so well to our time-series data. It felt good to connect what I was learning from YouTube, research papers, and Gemini with the real-world application in our project. This kind of self-guided learning reminded me how much I enjoy the challenge of understanding complex systems and making them useful. Looking forward to continuing this momentum as we refine our approach!
