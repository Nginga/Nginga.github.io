what_i_learned: |
  Today we did more data pre-processing using both one hour data from Padonia and Howard. Max and I worked on Howard data, and we were able to achieve a high r_2 score of 0.73 using gradient Boosting model. The rest of our day was dedicated to polishing our slides. We were able to work with our mentors in creating the best and most relevant versions of the slides. Lastly, we finished the day with presentation practice and trying to adjust everything to fit in the time limits of 15 to 20 minutes.

  Truncating our video demo to within 3 minutes was a challenge but we overcame.

reflection: |
  Today's major highlights were being able to work together with the rest of the team to finally determine the most important information to include in our slides. I enjoyed the collaborative spirit within our team and the aptitude to being at our best for each other. The highlights were the less revisions we got since the preliminary discussions yesterday. This showed me the amount of improvement and attention to correction which is also crucial to our project. Lookig forward to presenting tomorrow!
