what_i_learned: |
  Today I learnt more about txt file methods and string techniques like splitting and append. We did two exercises that included 
writing code to ask users for data, copying the data to new text files,and aslo looping to display. We also touched on AI and ML. 
We covered Gen AI, AI models, Prompt engineering, and played kahoot to check understanding.

reflection: |
   Today was a great conclusion on most python concepts we discussed in 102 class. The problems we did gave a good big picture view of everything.
  It was great to learn while playing kahoot, and also checking if pictures are AI generated or not.
