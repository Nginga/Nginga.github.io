what_i_learned: |
  Today was very busy. We worked on data that we started on yesterday to test two more machine learning models on top of Random forest. We then got more data from Howard stations and preprocessed it. later we then used different models  to test them. I deployed SVR, Linear Rgressor, And Gradient Booster models. Random Forest had the highest r_squared values. I'm looking forward to discussing our results

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today I learned more about the actual machine learning models that are there. I really enjoyed how they all differ from each other in their r2 values. The graphs were a bit different for predicted values vs actual, and this made me further apppreciate that certain models are more powerful in training certain data set types than others. Since ours was a regression supervised data, I now understand why RF would be a good fit. We also had a  great time as a team when we went through one of our assignments of explaining each line of code to each other.
