what_i_learned: |
  Today was very fun as we kicked out the day with fun games during SAIRI Cohort Connect. My team- team 1- lost the taboo game, but we came around to win the second one- Jenga. Taboo was new to me and I still enjoyed it the most! After the games, we learnt about creating and updating an overleaf site using the same format that we used in our github website. Our lunch was at a buffet with our fuculty and graduate mentors and we were celebrating the birthday of one of our mentors. We had great food and discussions ranging from our diverse cultural experiences to academia. The day was concluded by a focus on digging into literature for AI and ML and writing summaries of those while discussing differences between an ML model and Algorithm.

  Today was very informative and fun! I enjoyed the games as they allowed us to be ourselves while learning about each other. The lunc we had was great too. I learnt a lot about Asian culture from our faculty mentor including the most efficient ways of using chop sticks. The day started with a lot of fun and continued like that even during our dicussions on ML models and algorithms as we tried to dig through the internet to find the differences. The task was to put it in our own words, and I think that helped me learn better since I had to understand the concepts first. Overall, it was a day filled with success!
