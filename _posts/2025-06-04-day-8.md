what_i_learned: |
  Today we toured Morgan campus and got to learn more about the newly built structures on campus and the 125 year old football stadium! I learned a lot about how we will also have access to great gym and library facilities after getting our BEAR cards! We also went to launch a helium balloon with my team to collect climate data. The balloon has transmitters connected to it and send the data to our computer which has receiving antennas. This was a very interesting experience as we got to see our Lidars as well on a close range!

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Today felt like an immersion into the reality of scientific data collection and experimentation. Being taken throught the whole process of sending the helium balloon on take off and actually starting to receive transmitted data was very awesome. I also enjoyed how my team members were collaborating and enthusiastic about the whole process. Learning more about the school in our morning connectivity session was also fun and needed since i had been struggling with directions around campus lately :)
