reflection: |
  Today I had the chance to explore more into our initial 30_minute interval data for Howard and realized the missing data entries. It was great that we got new data to work with. I think I'm now comfortable with writing code except that I've been forgeting to take care of negative values in the preprocessing stage. Working with Max helped realize that the differences in our r_2 values was mainly due to the existance of negative AOD values. I also feel more comfortable to go a step further into neural networks before we go through them with my mentor and i think thats a plus. overall the day was great and filled with more learning, including the reminder that i need to keep my jucket on my bag everyday. We closed our day with two team building activities- Simon says and the word guessing game. It was fun!
