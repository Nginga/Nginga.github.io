what_i_learned: |
  Today we had to rerun our code for the three models - Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and GTW Tree using new data. The results came out lower than expected, with a highest r_2 value of 0.58 from Gradient boost. We then fine tuned the parameters for Random forest and that didn't yield any significant improvements. I also spent some time working on neural networks, just to see how the models are trained and deployed in predicting pollution/pm2.5. I was able to grasp the difference between using Pytorch and Tensor flow, with PyTorch being more preffered in research due to its flexibility. The last part of the day was dedicated to reviewing our presentation slides for Thursday.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Today was a bit low due to the results we were getting for both Padonia and Howard locations. Although these were not as expected, we still learned a few things during data preprocessing and model selection. The team was able to work together to ensure that we are not repeating the same mistake of deploying incomplete data, thus we were able to move forward knowing that the data was clean and ready to be worked on. Working together in ensuring that our slides look as we wish for Thursday was also fun. We got most of our slides approved with few additional changes noted. This set us on the right track for making sure we deliver our best on Thursday.
