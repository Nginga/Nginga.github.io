what_i_learned: |
  I learned how to create and post blogs on my webpage, update the about me page, and debugging. Had a refresher class in Python102 which focused on dictionaries and sets. Played a guessing game to refresh. Also met the entire team today including fuculty!

reflection: |
  Today was a great refresher for my python skills and meeting the full team including fuculty gave me a beter idea of the project and expectations. I realized that I will be using statistics, python, and satelite data during the duration of the project. With my current skills, the team re-assured us that we will be helped in catching up to speed with all necessary concepts!
