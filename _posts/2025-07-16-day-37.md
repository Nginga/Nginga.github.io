  Today, we received updated AOD data and successfully merged it with the existing meteorological and PM2.5 datasets. With this combined dataset, I retrained the LSTM model to predict PM2.5 concentrations using sequences of past data. After tuning and running multiple training iterations, the model achieved a highest R² score of 0.71, indicating that it can explain a good portion of the variance in the PM2.5 values.

  Later in the day, we also began drafting our report — specifically the abstract and introduction sections. This helped us start organizing our results and clearly framing the problem we’re trying to solve, which is key as we approach the final stages of the project.

  LSTM takes very long to run, approx 30 minutes, and this led to some delays in the process.

reflection: |
  Merging new datasets and retraining the model helped reinforce the importance of preprocessing and consistency in time-series data — especially when working with multiple sources. Achieving a strong R² score was rewarding, but visual inspection of the predictions also reminded me that model evaluation goes beyond just a single metric.Starting on the report made me realize how much progress we've made technically, and also how important it is to clearly communicate that progress. Writing the introduction pushed me to think about the bigger picture — the “why” behind this project — and how to express the impact of our work to a broader audience.
