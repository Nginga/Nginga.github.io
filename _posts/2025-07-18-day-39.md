what_i_learned: |
  Today, we visited the meteorological station and received a comprehensive tour of their instruments and operations. We learned how they collect environmental data through various tools, including sensors for wind speed, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature. A highlight of the visit was participating in a weather balloon launch, which plays a key role in gathering upper-atmospheric data. Additionally, we observed and assisted with the operation of drones used for real-time data collection. This hands-on experience gave me a deeper understanding of the data sources behind the PM2.5 readings we use in our project and showed how rigorous the data collection process is.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Seeing the meteorological equipment and processes in action brought our research to life. It was powerful to connect our models and datasets with the real-world instruments and scientists who make accurate environmental monitoring possible. The visit reinforced the importance of data integrity and made me appreciate the collaboration in data collection to model training and prediction that supports environmental research. It also inspired me to think more critically about how to represent and interpret the data in ways that honor the effort and precision that go into gathering it.
