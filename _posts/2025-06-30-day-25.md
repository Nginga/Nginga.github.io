what_i_learned: |
  Today we got new data sets to train. The previous data had missing entries for the each year after April until December starting in 2019 to 2022. This was rectied when our mentor sent one hour data for both howard and padonia locations. Max and I worked on the Howard data and we managed to get an r_squared value of 0.56. This i way lower than the previous values we got working with wrong data, but still can be a good starting point. I think the reason might be the fewer data entries on the 1 hour entries. I also started looking into how LSTM can be implemented in our research as one of the best neural networks for long term time varying data.

  Our room was colder than normal, and I forgot my jacket

reflection: |
  Today I had the chance to explore more into our initial 30_minute interval data for Howard and realized the missing data entries. It was great that we got new data to work with. I think I'm now comfortable with writing code except that I've been forgeting to take care of negative values in the preprocessing stage. Working with Max helped realize that the differences in our r_2 values was mainly due to the existance of negative AOD values. I also feel more comfortable to go a step further into neural networks before we go through them with my mentor and i think thats a plus. overall the day was great and filled with more learning, including the reminder that i need to keep my jucket on my bag everyday. We closed our day with two team building activities- Simon says and the word guessing game. It was fun!
