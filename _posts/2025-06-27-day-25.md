what_i_learned: |
  Today we looked at Neural Networks. I learned about the different types and mostly focusing on reccurent neural networks. I learned that the regular RNNs have gradient vanishing ishues and only work with very short term data like in a sensor. There are more stronger RNNs like Long Short Term Memory RNNs that actuelly solve that problem. We also worked on our weekly video presentation, and made more changes to the mid summer powerpoint deck.

  Our room was colder than normal today.

reflection: |
  Today I had a more exhaustive dive into neural networks and that got me motivated. Looking at the demontrations online and the implementations of Pytorch and Tensor flow was new and confusing at first since I couldn't really visualize the math behind the models. With more digging, I was able to learn more from examples that were utilizing Numpy and that helped me get a clearer picture. Moving forward, I have learned that I can rely on detailed breakdowns that utilize Numpy and then go back to the shorter and more condensed algorithms in deep learning. I also had a good reflection time during our problem solving session with Dr Li as we tried to figure out what might have gone wrong with the missing datapoints and then I had to use my Excel and pivot table experience to get through that.
