what_i_learned: |
  Today was filled with more reinforcement on the Machine learning models we have been deploying the whole week. I went through text and videos trying to understand the development, function, strengths, and perks of each model. Having had the practical application during the week, I had to solidify more of my understanding through MIT, Stanford and other useful video resources including w3 schools. We also worked on our equipment room to clean it up and create more space for accomodating our drone and balloon equipment. Also worked on our weekly video!

  It was a bit challenging to hop back to learning mode after the holiday.

reflection: |
  Today was very satisfying as far as the learning went. I kept delving deeper and deeper into the math and fundamentals behind the building of ML models. I also enjoyed the ease to which this was since we had already gone through the practical aspect of writing code to deploy these algorithms. Today felt more like a great conclusion to a week that might be the week i did the most learning so far! I do enjoy the concepts of climate science that we're using for data analytics, but getting ML models to play with that data makes the physics more astronomically interesting!
