  Today we contuinued working on Howard and Padonia data to get more refined results. I was focusing on the Howard data together with Max and we were able to uncover a new model/algorithm from a paper he reveiwed which produced the highest r_2 value so far >0.9. His result was the first to surpass Random Forest which had yielded 0.86 as the highest r_2 value so far. We also worked on graphically representing our data monthly and that made us realize that there were gaps in the data for both Howard and Padonia. We are still working on trying other algorythms. Lastly, we worked on our presentation for Friday.

  The data has gaps for all the years since 2019, thus our model will not give the most accurate predictions for now.

reflection: |
  It was great to try algorithms from literature reviews since it helped us understand the connection between literature, research, and just being able to go beyond what we have been taught or introduced to. I enjoyed a small game called musical chairs which loosened the day as we played as a team. I think being able to represent data monthly was great since it explained a lot about why our models may be having issues sometimes. I also had some moent to reflect on what we have covered so far as I worked on our final presentation for this coming Friday. Its interesting to see how far we have come from a point where I did not know anything about aerosols to this point where I now feel more comfortable.
