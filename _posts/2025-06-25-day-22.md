what_i_learned: |
  Today I worked on neural networks review prio to our scheduled discussion with our Mentor. I went through different sites like IBM and tried to understand how neural networks actually work. I learned that they simulate human neural behavioh functionality and how they are similar to trees in having nodes and branches. The other part of the day was spent finishing and reviewing the slides for our midterm presentation. We worked on the contents of the slides as well as the strategy that will be employed in the presentation.

  Adjusting to a  new environment in the business building due to AC issues in our original location.

reflection: |
  Today was more of digging through information sources to learn more about neural networks and how we can implement them in our project. I quickly found out that CNN( Convolutional Neural Networks ) are mostly emplyed in computer vision. Since our data is not necessarily in form of pictures or graphics, I think the we may be leaning towards long short term memory models. The introduction gave me more confidence in the concepts that are upcoming and I'm glad most of this basically involves math/statistics. Spending the rest of the day reviewing our presentation was great too as I was able to locate my mistakes and ask questions on certain inconstances!
