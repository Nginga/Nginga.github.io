what_i_learned: |
  Today started with a morning event focused on discovering our strengths and learning styles. I learned that my key strengths lie in managing and supervising tasks, which aligns with my natural tendency to organize, delegate, and guide group efforts. When it comes to learning, I discovered that I’m a multimodal learner—with visual learning as my strongest mode, followed closely by reading. This insight will help me tailor how I take in technical material going forward.

  Later in the day, we had a planning meeting with the team to discuss the next phase of our project. We outlined immediate steps, identified what’s working well, and highlighted areas that need more attention—especially around data modeling and final report planning.

  Finally, I spent the rest of the day continuing development on the LSTM model for PM2.5 prediction. I improved the model by extending the sequence length, adding lagged PM2.5 values, and including new features like rolling means and time-based components. I also tuned hyperparameters such as the number of LSTM layers, hidden size, dropout, and batch size. While the model’s R² score is still modest, it's improving steadily, and I plan to benchmark it against other models next.

reflection: |
  Today gave me a deeper understanding of myself—not just as a learner, but also as a teammate and leader. Realizing that I thrive in managing and supervising roles reminded me of how much I enjoy organizing complex tasks and guiding others through execution. Learning that I’m a visual and reading-oriented learner also affirmed why diagrams, charts, and structured documentation help me grasp technical ideas more clearly. The morning session helped me reframe how I approach group work and how I should structure my personal learning moving forward.On the technical side, working on the LSTM model was both rewarding and humbling. Although the R² score still has room for improvement, I’ve learned a lot about feature engineering, model structure, and tuning. Every iteration teaches me something new—not just about the data, but about how small adjustments can make a big difference. I’m excited to keep building and testing, and I’m gaining confidence in my ability to apply machine learning concepts meaningfully to real-world data.
