  Today I continued exploring neural networks, focusing more deeply on how different architectures handle sequential data. I revisited core concepts of LSTMs but also began looking into GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) and how they compare in performance and complexity. This helped me think more critically about which models might be more efficient or suitable given the size and structure of our PM2.5 dataset. I also started reviewing examples of how researchers have combined traditional machine learning with neural networks to improve accuracy.

  We had a reflection meeting as a team today where we went over feedback from Dr. Li and re-aligned on our project goals for the rest of the internship. The conversation helped clarify our focus: we need to collect additional relevant datasets and begin implementing neural models like LSTM and GRU to see how well they predict PM2.5 concentrations over time.

  My car battery died, and I had to adjust my schedule. Hoping to be able to get it fixed today.

reflection: |
  Today’s highlight was our team reflection session. It was helpful to pause and assess how far we’ve come, what we’ve learned, and where we need to go next. Hearing everyone's perspectives made it clear that we’re all on the same page about diving into neural network implementation. I felt encouraged by the fact that the team is growing more confident in the technical direction we're heading. Personally, I’m excited to apply the theoretical understanding I’ve been building to actual models and predictions in the coming week. The combination of technical deep dives and group reflection really helped bring purpose and clarity to today’s work.
