what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on understanding how to prepare time series data for LSTM models, specifically by learning how to generate sequences using a sliding window approach. I studied how each iteration of the loop extracts a chunk of data of a fixed size (defined by the number of time steps) and uses it as an input, while the immediate next value serves as the target. This helped me clearly understand how overlapping sequences are built and how they form the necessary input shape for LSTM: (samples, time steps, features). I now see how this process transforms flat historical data into something a sequential model can learn from. In addition to the technical learning, I also spent time understanding how to write our final report. I explored how to properly organize sections like the introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion, and how to use our research objectives and model evaluation to structure a cohesive narrative. This also gave me a clearer sense of how to integrate the technical depth of our work with good scientific writing practices.

  I felt like i needed to review both LSTM and CNN since most research papers that got the best results used those, but realized we dont have pictorial data. 

reflection: |
  Working through the loop that generates sequences gave me a new level of confidence in handling time series data for neural networks. At first, I found the logic a bit confusing, especially in terms of how the indexing aligns the inputs and outputs, but breaking it down line by line helped everything fall into place. I now appreciate how critical this transformation step is — without it, the model would have no way to understand temporal patterns. On the writing side, learning how to draft the final report reminded me that being able to communicate technical work is just as important as doing the work itself. It's not enough to build accurate models; we also have to tell the story of the problem we addressed, how we approached it, and what the results mean. These two skills — technical modeling and clear communication — go hand in hand, and today's work helped me strengthen both.
