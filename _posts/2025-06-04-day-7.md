what_i_learned: |
  Today I learnt more about the NASA Giovanni satelite database that our team will be using. The data dates back years ago and contains a lot of climate related and materiological information. This data is dowloaded in the form of CSV files and then we clean it. The CSV file is what our team will be using including data from our ground stations, to train out AI model.   Me and my teammates were able to create a small CSV file that we read using python, as a practice exercise. Dr. Li also outlined importants aspects of the project including more insights on the concepts that have been introduced to us already.

reflection: |
  Today was awesome as we met with our fuculty mentor, Dr Li, for the first time in person. She is a very incredible personality and was happy to meet us. She definitely made me more excited about my whole team and just looking forward to being a part of the project. I learned more about the importance of curiocity and asking questions, something that has always driven me in my journey as an engineer/ scientist. Hearing it from Dr Li was special, as it made me realize that I probably have the right mindset for research preparedness!
