what_i_learned: |
  Today I learnt a totally new skill about computer vision! We used google colab to write code that let the computer identify objects in an image. The next challenge involved detecting objects in a short video.
  The next sesion involved playing escape room with my team. We managed to solve after about 30 minutes. The last session was on python text files, reading and writing to them. 

blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was filled with a lot of great new concepts from computer vision to python text files and escape room. The idea of learning new concepts always gets me excited and going thus this day proved to be one of my favorites so far.
