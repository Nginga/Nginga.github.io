what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on preparing the final presentation for our research project. My main task was refining and organizing the methodology slides, making sure they clearly communicated our experimental process and analytical approach. It was a rewarding challenge to synthesize weeks of work into concise, visual storytelling. We also completed a full rehearsal of the presentation, which helped us smooth transitions and build confidence in our delivery. In parallel, we finalized the research paper—proofreading, formatting citations, and ensuring consistency across all sections. It felt great to see the full product of our summer efforts come together in both written and oral form.

  I arrived at 6am from the Apple conference i attended in California, and felt jet-legged but still endured it in order to get things done.

reflection: |
  Wrapping up the program today came with a mix of excitement, pride, and fullilment. Working with my team over the past weeks taught me a lot about collaboration, accountability, and the value of different perspectives. Preparing the final presentation and paper reminded me how powerful it is to turn raw ideas and scattered data into something coherent and impactful. It’s been a meaningful experience not only for the skills I’ve gained, but also for the relationships we built as a team. I’m walking away from this summer more confident in my research abilities and more inspired to keep pursuing work that blends creativity, technical rigor, and purpose.
