  Today, I focused on working on the final report for our research project. I reviewed and refined the background section, ensuring it clearly contextualizes the PM2.5 problem and the relevance of our approach. I also spent time organizing and summarizing the research papers we reviewed, which helped strengthen our literature section. In addition to the writing, I generated performance metrics—including MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R²—for the three models we used: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM. This allowed me to quantitatively compare their effectiveness in predicting PM2.5 concentrations and assess the trade-offs between classical ensemble methods and deep learning models.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Today’s work gave me a more holistic view of how to tie together the different pieces of our project—literature, methodology, and results—into a coherent research paper. Calculating the evaluation metrics made me more confident in interpreting model performance and justifying our choices in the report. Writing the background helped me better articulate the urgency of PM2.5 prediction and gave me a sense of responsibility in presenting the science accurately. While technical work has been a core part of this project, I now see how critical effective communication is for the impact of research.
