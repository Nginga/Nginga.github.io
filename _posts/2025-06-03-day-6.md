what_i_learned: |
  Today we reviewed literature and that included two papers from each participant. My papers touched on environmental justice and monitoring urban air pollution to fight for neighborhoods that are exposed to coal mining pollution. The second paper was on the use of diferent data sources and sensors including distribution of portable censors and satelite data to traind deep learning neural networks for polution monitoring. Our project will implement AI to be able to predict what ground data would be in areas where there's only satelite sensor coverage by correlating what we have found to be their relationship in those regions that have both forms of data.
  I had the opportunity to learn more indepth about terminology and technical features involved in climate science. Some of them include LiDAR, AOD(Aerosol Optical Depth), BC(Black Carbon).

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today gave me more confidence in understanding research methodology and how literature is reveiwed. I also had an incredible time sharing what I learned from the papers I went through. This bolstered my confidence as I'm not intimidated by the next steps in our project.
