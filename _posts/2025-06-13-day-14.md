what_i_learned: |
  Today we went through the AI and ML literature, discussing the different ML algorithms and why diffent types of models like LSTM are suited for time series data. We were able to learn what other researchers chose as the best model for different research purposes that are close to ours.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was very informative and fun! I enjoyed the games as they allowed us to be ourselves while learning about each other. The lunc we had was great too. I learnt a lot about Asian culture from our faculty mentor including the most efficient ways of using chop sticks. The day started with a lot of fun and continued like that even during our dicussions on ML models and algorithms as we tried to dig through the internet to find the differences. The task was to put it in our own words, and I think that helped me learn better since I had to understand the concepts first. Overall, it was a day filled with success!
