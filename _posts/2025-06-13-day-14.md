what_i_learned: |
  Today we went through the AI and ML literature, discussing the different ML algorithms and why diffent types of models like LSTM are suited for time series data. We were able to learn what other researchers chose as the best model for different research purposes that are close to ours.The rest of the day was on the pre-processing of datasets that we will then use for training our AI model nextweek. The steps involve medging all our documents together and then removing null rows. We also play around different libraries and graphs.

reflection: |
  Today was mainly a great adventure as far as ML models are used in research. Being able to learn from the literatures my teammates found helped deepen my understanding of different ML models and algorithms. I also enjoyed the pre-processing of data to accomplish similar outputs that we had accomplished with our mentor. I also enjoyed the car experiment at the transportation lab, as it introduced a phenomenon that might be futuristic in nature- ground drones! I also enjoyed the co-ordination we do as a team in our work and making our slides with reflection of each day since the week started.
