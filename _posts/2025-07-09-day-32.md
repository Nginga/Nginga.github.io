what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about the two main methods of implementing LSTM models, which deepened my understanding of how these networks can be applied to our time-series prediction tasks. I also spent time exploring different ways to interpolate our data in order to generate more data points. This step is important for strengthening our model's ability to detect patterns over time. The next task I’ll be working on is plotting graphs of PM2.5 (yearly) versus time and AOD to check whether the interpolated data maintains the overall trends we expect to see. This will help validate whether our data augmentation process is working as intended.

  Pytorch was a bit challenging to understand since i could not get enough examples relating to pollution or pm2.5.

reflection: |
  I really enjoyed today’s learning process—especially being able to build on what I already knew about LSTMs and time-series modeling. Exploring interpolation techniques helped me appreciate the role of data completeness and consistency in improving model performance. It felt rewarding to connect theoretical methods with practical steps that directly impact our project. I'm looking forward to visualizing the data next and seeing if the trends align with what we expect—that’ll be a solid checkpoint for our progress.
