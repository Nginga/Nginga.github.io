what_i_learned: |
  Today we went through more literature and reviewed topics around the use of AI and ML in the monitoring of pollution. We started by critiquing papers we had found yesterday, which focused on Aerosol lifecycles and then started working on finding ones relating AI and ML to monitoring pollution. The rest of the after lunch period was dedicated to a lot of fun programming in pyhton and plotting various graphs using pandas. We also started talking about how our data can be used to train machine learning models!

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was very informative! It was one of my best learning days as we tied everything we are doing into creatig a realistic ML mpodel. Going through literature to see what others did to solve similar problems was very helpful in creating the best mindset for me to understand the information we went through in our python time. I aslo realized the inportance of getting enough sleep, drinking water, and taking short naps after lunch in inmproving my concentration!
