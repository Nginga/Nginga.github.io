what_i_learned: |
  Today we spent mont of the time cleaning our ground-based LiDAR. The LiDAR is part of the data collection instruments that help us gather metereological and particulate data which we will later use in conjunction with our satelite data from NASA. The maintainance process is a regular exercise done every six months. Futhermore, we discussed about our progress in learning python including the prviously assigned tasks of utiliziting python libraries like numpy. Next steps were discussed and this included Mike promising to provide an outline that we will follow in gearing up our python techniques.

  Suns heat and a couple of insects roaming around during the LiDAR cleaning process. Nothing we couldn't overcome!

reflection: |
  A lot of maintainance training today helped me understand not only the financial importance of keeping our equipment clean as per instruction but the overall impact of taking care of things that matter just like my car, which ends up preventing more costs in trying to fix what could be prevented. Another important aspect of the LiDAR maintaince training was learning the importance of safety precautions. LiDARs use laser beams and these can be deadly when exposure is directed towards a person. Beyond today, I have a good feeling about my learning journey and being told more details about our next steps bolstered my confidence!
