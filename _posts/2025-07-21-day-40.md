what_i_learned: |
  Today began with an Overleaf workshop focused on helping us prepare for writing our final reports. I learned how to use Overleaf effectively by creating and managing project files, structuring documents through the creation of new .tex files for each section, and including them in the main file using the \input{} command. I also learned how to create a separate bibliography file (.bib) to manage references and how to import citation entries directly from Google Scholar. Later in the day, I shifted focus to our machine learning code, where I worked on fixing bugs in both the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. These debugging efforts significantly improved the model performance, with R² values increasing to 0.80 for Gradient Boost and 0.78 for Random Forest. I also reviewed the LSTM model to ensure consistency across the implementations.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Learning Overleaf was empowering—it’s a professional tool that will make final report writing more organized and polished. Understanding how to structure files and manage references will definitely help streamline the process. Debugging the code was also satisfying; fixing the bugs gave me a clearer picture of the true performance of our models. Seeing R² values close to 0.8 confirmed that the models are learning meaningful patterns, which motivates me to further optimize them. Overall, today felt like a good balance between technical learning and practical problem-solving.
